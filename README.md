# 3060-AR
This mobile app is built with Unity / Vuforia, with the contents targeting on the course materials in MAEG 3060. The app presents some examples of possible applications of AR technology in enhancing the teaching and learning experiences, including:

* Scalable inertial and non-inertial frames
* Real-time rendered base to end-effection vector
* Real-time robot angle data through internet
* Path trailing with user defined time interval nodes
* Vertical, horizonal and overall workspace region

### Using the demo app
Please feel free to build the app to the targeted device (although only Andriod has been tested).

1. To smoothly use the app, connect the mobile device to a CUHK network (eg. CUHK CUHK1x). This allows the app to access the robot angle data from the school server.
2. On the main page select the robot arm ID that you would like to visualise. (Currently only 3 robot arms are allowed for user to connect to.)
3. Click on **AR Workspace** to visualise the workspace of the robot arm. 3 modes are available, namely vertical, horizontal, and overall.
4. Click on **AR Demo** for all the other mentioned AR demo examples. The controls and setting buttons are on the lower right corner.
5. If the school server is connected correctly, the robot arm pose display on both AR pages will be updated at fixed rate automatically. Click on the **"<"** sign on the top left corner to return to the main page.
6. Click on **Quit** to quit the app.
